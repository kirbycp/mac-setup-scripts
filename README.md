# Mac-Setup-Scripts

Setting up a new Macbook it a two step process. First these scripts install the base packages and apps. Then my second repo contains all of the dot files that are stored in a bare git repo, which means you clone the repo directly into your home directory and can sync them any time useing the command dotfiles push, pull commit etc.
